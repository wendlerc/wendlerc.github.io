# Study materials

## Autoregressive transformer & mechanistic interpretability

* [CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/), [assignments](https://github.com/stanford-cs336)
* [ARENAv3: Alignment research engineer accelerator](https://arena-resources.notion.site)
* [ARENAv2](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_2.0); not sure what changed in v3, I mostly looked at v2 but sadly v2 does not have its notion page anymore 

## More general background knowledge

* [The little book of deep learning](https://fleuret.org/francois/lbdl.html)
* [Probabilistic artificial intelligence course material](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05244)

## My bachelor thesis
* [Das stochastische Gradientenverfahren](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kcd7ypDvmzq_sIUqRg4KuxRMR1jrnfA8/view?usp=sharing); adding this here because this had a lot of traffic on my old website, this is only useful for German speakers;
