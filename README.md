# minimal-academic-website

If you are an academic, **[you should have a website](https://kenworthy.space/advice.html#advpage)**. _Really._ It‚Äôs just frustrating and annoying if you are trying to google somebody because you have read their paper / seen their poster / some other reason, and want to get in touch, and you can‚Äôt even find an e-mail address.

This repository here is meant to help you get started by providing you with everything you need to have your own minimal website up and running in (hopefully) less than 10 minutes. It will look something like this:

## ‚ö°Ô∏èQuickstart

1. This guide assumes that you will be hosting your website on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). (Of course, the template also works if you are hosting the website somewhere else.) This means that, as a first step, you will need to [get a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you do not have one already. Ideally, choose a somewhat ‚Äúserious‚Äù username, as it will become part of your website‚Äôs URL.

2. Once you are signed into your GitHub account, create a new repository. Choose the following repository name:

   ```
   <your_github_username>.github.io
   ```

   Note: It needs to be *exactly* this pattern, otherwise it won‚Äôt work. The repository should be ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù, and you might want to ‚ÄúAdd a README file‚Äù so that you can clone the repository right away.

3. Clone the repository you have just created to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/<your_github_username>.github.io.git
   ```

4. Add the relevant files from _this_ repository (i.e., the `index.html`, `main.css`, `image.png`, `favicon.png`) to the copy of _your_ repository that you have just cloned.

5. Use a text editor of your choice to edit the `index.html` to match you, that is, add your name, a short description, relevant links (e.g., to your Google Scholar profile) and so on (see also below). Most of it should be pretty self-explanatory. Also, change the `image.png` to a picture of yourself. You should be able to preview all changes directly by opening the `index.html` in your browser.

6. Maybe add [a favicon](https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/). The code for this is already in the `<head>` section of the template; you only need to add a suitable `favicon.png` file. You can use, for example, [this online generator](https://favicon.io/) to create an icon with your initials or something like that.

7. Once you are happy with your changes, stage and commit your changes and push them to GitHub, using something like this:

   ```
   git add --all
   git commit -m "First commit"
   git push
   ```

8. That‚Äôs it! ü•≥ Maybe you need to wait a few minutes for the changes to become active, but pretty soon your website should be available at `https://<your_github_username>.github.io`. (BTW, for some extra professionalism, it‚Äôs also pretty easy and cheap to set it up to use a custom domain, like, `yourname.com`.)



## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

This template is intentionally kept very minimalistic. Of course, you should feel to expand on it as much as you like. Most of the looks are controlled by the `main.css` file, so this would be a good starting point for changing things like, e.g., the color scheme or the fonts. Here are a few additional hints to get started:

* **Icons:** The icons to link to your social media profiles or other websites are based on [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/). Adding a new icon is pretty simple. For example, to add your ORCiD, you‚Äôd need this:

  ```
  <a href="link to orcid profile"><i class="ai ai-orcid"></i></a>
  ```

* **Fonts:** The easiest way to add fonts is to use [Google Webfonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Just pick a font that you like and it will tell you which bit of code you need to add to the `<head>` section of your `index.html`.

Ultimately, if you want are more complex website (e.g., with sub-pages, or a blog, or ...), but still keep the GitHub pages-based approach, you might want to look into static website generators such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

# Chris Wendler's Interactive Space Website (from here things are written by Claude3.7)

This is an interactive space-themed personal website for Chris Wendler featuring a game-like star animation with multiple phases and special effects.

## Features

- Interactive star field animation with parallax effect
- Spaceship cursor that interacts with stars and leaves a particle trail
- Game-like progression with multiple phases:
  - Phase 1: Normal mode - stars move away from the spaceship
  - Phase 2: Blue chase mode (after 42 hits) - blue stars begin to chase the spaceship
  - Phase 3: Red chase mode (after 84 hits) - red stars chase more aggressively
  - Phase 4: Rainbow chase mode (after 126 hits) - colorful stars chase at maximum intensity
  - Phase 5: Explosion (after 168 hits) - spaceship explodes and game ends
- Special power-ups that appear randomly:
  - Shield power-up (gold star) - provides temporary invincibility
  - Reduce power-up (green star) - reduces hit count by 5
- Visual effects:
  - Particle trail behind the spaceship
  - Shockwave effects on collisions
  - Shield visual effect when active
- Sound effects for collisions, power-ups, and phase transitions (can be toggled)
- Gradually increasing star density and speed through game phases
- Hit counter display
- Aggressive chasing behavior with stars actively pursuing the spaceship
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## How to Play

1. Move your mouse around to navigate the spaceship
2. Collide with the larger stars (marked with red circles) to increase your hit counter
3. Collect special power-up stars for temporary advantages:
   - Gold stars: Temporary invincibility
   - Green stars: Reduce your hit count by 5
4. Reach 42 hits to activate blue chase mode
5. Reach 84 hits to activate red chase mode
6. Reach 126 hits to activate rainbow mode
7. Reach 168 hits to trigger the explosion finale

## Controls

- Mouse movement: Control the spaceship
- Sound button (bottom right): Toggle sound effects on/off
